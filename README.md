**Select the most appropriate medium for client engagement**

Identify the ways via which your consumers like to contact you, whether it’s through your website, mobile app, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, or other messaging services.


**Teach your bot** 

Depending on your company objectives, you may use detailed FAQs to train your bot. This will make it easier for the bot to respond appropriately to your customers or visitors.


**Give your bot a voice and personality** 

Give your bot a name and an image that compliments your business message to give it more personality.


**Create a balanced approach** 

Most chatbots aren’t very effective, and consumers will eventually seek chat help. You may specify when your consumers will have the opportunity to speak with a live representative.
